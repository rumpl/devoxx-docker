# Create a processes

Technically, at its lowest level a container is a Linux process isolated using
`cgroups` (control groups) and `namespaces` (like PID, net, mount, user, etc.)
to restrict resource usage and provide a separate view of the system.

Let's start small and first only create a new process.

# Step 1: create the main function

Set up the basic program structure:

```go
func main() {
	// TODO: Check if we're running the initial command or the child process
	// If args contain "child", call child()
	// Otherwise, continue with parent process creation
}
```

# Step 2: the child process

Create the child process handler:

```go
func child() error {
	// TODO:
	// 1. Print the PID of the current process
	// 2. Execute the desired command, printing a simple `Hello from child` is enough for now
}
```

# Step 3: the parent process

Create a function to handle parent process logic:

```golang
func run() error {
	// TODO:
	// 1. Print the PID of the current process
	// 2. Create a new process using current executable
	// 3. Set up stdin/stdout/stderr
	// 4. Start the child process
	// 5. Wait for completion and print a message letting us know the child process has exited
}
```

- Use `os.Getpid()` to get the pid of the current process
- Use `/proc/self/exe` to re-execute the same process
- Use `os.Args` to detect if running as child
- Use `cmd.Start()` and `cmd.Wait()` for better process control

# Step 4: test

1. Build and run your program:

```console
# Build the program
go build -o devoxx-container

# Run the program
./devoxx-container
PARENT: Hello from parent, my pid is 1234
CHILD: Hello from child, my pid is 1325
PARENT: Child exited with exit code 0
```

# Summary

We have the basic first step into our journey to creating a container, we have a
parent process that can manage the child process. This child process will soon
become a real container.
